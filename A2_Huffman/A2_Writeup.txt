A(2) Write a program to implement Huffman Encoding using a greedy strategy.

Huffman Encoding is an optimal prefix coding technique used for lossless data compression. It assigns shorter binary codes to characters occurring more frequently and longer codes to less frequent characters. The algorithm follows a greedy strategy by repeatedly selecting two nodes with the smallest frequencies to build the Huffman Tree. This ensures minimal weighted path cost, making Huffman Encoding one of the most efficient compression algorithms. The result is a variable-length prefix-free binary code for each character in the input.

ALGORITHM

Huffman Encoding Algorithm (Greedy Approach)

Start

Calculate frequency of each character in the input text

Create a min-heap (priority queue) where each node stores a character and its frequency

While heap size > 1:
  • Remove two nodes with minimum frequency
  • Create a new internal node with frequency = sum of both nodes
  • Set the two nodes as left and right children
  • Insert the new node back into the heap

The remaining node in the heap is the root of the Huffman Tree

Traverse the tree:
  • Assign '0' to left edges and '1' to right edges
  • Collect binary codes for all characters

Print the Huffman Codes

End

CONCLUSION
Huffman Encoding efficiently compresses data by assigning optimal variable-length codes to characters based on frequency. Using a greedy strategy ensures that at each step the smallest available nodes are combined, minimizing the overall weighted path length. As a result, Huffman Encoding produces compression close to theoretical entropy limits, making it widely used in file compression formats such as ZIP, GZIP, and multimedia standards.
