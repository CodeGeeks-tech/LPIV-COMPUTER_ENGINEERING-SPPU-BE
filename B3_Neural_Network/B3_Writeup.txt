B(3)  Given a bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months. 

THEORY

Customer churn refers to the likelihood of customers leaving a company within a given period. Predicting churn is essential for banks to identify at-risk customers and take preventive measures. In this task, a binary classification neural network is built to predict whether a bank customer will leave within the next 6 months.

The dataset (Churn_Modelling.csv) contains demographic, geographic, and financial information. Features such as Geography and Gender are categorical, while others are numerical. Data preprocessing includes one-hot encoding and standardization. The model is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with hidden layers, dropout for regularization, and a sigmoid output for binary classification.

The ANN is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.


ALGORITHM
Neural Network-Based Churn Prediction Algorithm

Start

Import dataset and select relevant features

Separate inputs (X) and target (Y = Churn column)

Preprocess data:
  • One-hot encode categorical variables
  • Standardize numerical features

Split into training and testing sets

Build ANN with:
  • Input layer
  • Two hidden layers (ReLU activation)
  • Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
  • Output layer (Sigmoid activation for binary output)

Compile model using Adam optimizer

Train ANN for 100 epochs with batch size of 32

Predict on test data using threshold = 0.5

Compute confusion matrix and accuracy

Interpret results

End

CONCLUSION

A Neural Network-based binary classifier was successfully implemented to predict whether a bank customer will churn within the next 6 months. By preprocessing the data, encoding categorical fields, scaling inputs, and designing a robust ANN model, high predictive accuracy was achieved. The results demonstrate that neural networks are powerful tools for customer retention analytics, enabling banks to proactively identify at-risk customers and take corrective actions.
