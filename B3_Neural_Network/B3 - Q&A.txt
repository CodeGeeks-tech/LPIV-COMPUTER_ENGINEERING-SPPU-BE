1. What is customer churn?

Answer:
Customer churn means a customer leaves or stops using the service. In this dataset, churn = 1 means the customer left.

2. What is the target variable in the dataset?

Answer:
The Churn column (index 12), stored in Y.

3. Why do we drop CustomerId and Surname?

Answer:
Because they do not contribute to prediction. They are identifiers, not meaningful features.

4. Why is One-Hot Encoding used?

Answer:
To convert categorical variables (Gender, Geography) into numerical format that neural networks can understand.

5. Why does OneHotEncoder(drop='first') drop the first category?

Answer:
To avoid dummy variable trap, preventing multicollinearity among encoded features.

6. Why is StandardScaler used?

Answer:
To scale all features to the same range, improving ANN training stability and speed.

7. What does the pipeline do?

Answer:
It combines preprocessing steps (encoding + scaling) into a single automated workflow.

8. What is the input shape given to the first Dense layer?

Answer:
input_shape = (X_train.shape[1],)
This equals the number of transformed features after encoding.

9. What activation function is used in hidden layers?

Answer:
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) — commonly used for deep learning models.

10. Why do we use Dropout?

Answer:
To prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.

11. What is the output activation function and why?

Answer:
Sigmoid, because this is a binary classification problem with output ∈ {0,1}.

12. What loss function is used and why?

Answer:
binary_crossentropy — ideal for binary classification problems.

13. What optimizer is used in the ANN?

Answer:
Adam, an efficient gradient-based optimizer.

14. How many epochs are used for training?

Answer:
100 epochs.

15. What does batch_size = 32 mean?

Answer:
Training is done in mini-batches of 32 samples at a time.

16. What is validation_split = 0.1 used for?

Answer:
It reserves 10% of training data for validation, helping detect overfitting.

17. What does classifier.predict(X_test) output?

Answer:
Probabilities between 0 and 1 representing the model’s confidence a customer will churn.

18. Why do we convert predictions using (y_pred > 0.5)?

Answer:
To convert predicted probabilities into binary output (0 or 1).

19. What does a confusion matrix tell us?

Answer:
It shows:

True Positives

True Negatives

False Positives

False Negatives

Useful for evaluating classifier performance.

20. How is accuracy calculated in the code?

Answer:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / total test samples × 100%

21. What is overfitting?

Answer:
When a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data because it memorized patterns.

22. How does Dropout prevent overfitting?

Answer:
By randomly removing neurons during training, making the network more generalizable.

23. Why is an ANN suitable for churn prediction?

Answer:
Because ANN can model:

Non-linear relationships

Multiple interacting features

Complex decision boundaries

24. What does the history object store?

Answer:
Training and validation:

Accuracy

Loss
Over the 100 epochs.

25. What is the expected output of the model?

Answer:
Whether a customer will leave (1) or stay (0) in the next 6 months.
