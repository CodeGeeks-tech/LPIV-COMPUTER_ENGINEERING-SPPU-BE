✅ SECTION 1 — 25 Q&A for C(2): Bank Smart Contract (Deposit, Withdraw, Show Balance)

These cover:

✔ Solidity basics
✔ Payable functions
✔ Ether transfers
✔ Gas concepts
✔ Your code logic
✔ Common mistakes
✔ Blockchain/viva concepts

1. What is the purpose of this smart contract?

To simulate a bank account on the Ethereum blockchain with operations:

Deposit

Withdraw

Show Balance

2. Who becomes the account owner?

The wallet that deploys the contract:

accOwner = msg.sender;

3. Why are deposit and withdraw functions marked as payable?

Because these functions handle Ether transactions.
payable allows the function to receive Ether.

4. What does msg.value represent?

The amount of Ether sent along with the transaction.

5. Why is the require statement used in deposit?

To ensure only the account owner can deposit money:

require(accOwner == msg.sender);

6. Why must msg.value > 0 in deposit?

To prevent zero-value deposits and waste of gas.

7. What is the error in the Withdraw function?

This condition is wrong:

require(msg.value > balance);


Should be:

require(amount <= balance);

8. Why is balance stored as a state variable?

Because Ether balance must persist across transactions and resets.

9. What is the visibility of showBalance()?

view — it reads state but does not modify it.

10. Who can withdraw money?

Only the account owner.

11. What happens if someone else tries to withdraw?

The transaction reverts with the message:
“You are not an account owner”.

12. Why is withdrawal not sending Ether back to the user?

Because the function reduces only the internal variable balance.
Actual transfer is missing (payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount) is needed).

13. What is gas?

The fee required to execute smart contract code on Ethereum.

14. Which operation consumes the most gas?

Withdrawal or deposit, because they modify blockchain storage.

15. Are read-only functions charged gas?

No—view functions called externally are gas-free.

16. What happens if withdraw amount is greater than the saved balance?

The transaction is reverted due to the require condition.

17. What happens if someone sends Ether directly to the contract?

The contract lacks a fallback/receive function → the transaction fails.

18. What does payable keyword allow?

Enables receiving Ether during function calls.

19. Why should withdraw use call() instead of transfer()?

Because transfer() is limited to 2300 gas and may fail in modern EVM rules.

20. Why is msg.sender important?

It identifies the caller's address—essential for permissions.

21. Can this contract hold Ether securely?

Yes, but withdrawal logic must be corrected for real-world deployment.

22. What is a security issue in this contract?

It does not check for re-entrancy (though simple subtraction prevents loops).

23. Is this contract upgradeable?

No. Once deployed, Solidity contracts are immutable.

24. Where is the Ether actually stored?

In the contract’s Ethereum address balance, not in the variable.

25. Does this contract send Ether back during withdrawal?

No, the contract only decreases balance. It must add payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount).

✅ SECTION 2 — Additional Solidity Programming Viva Questions

These are general blockchain/solidity questions similar to your C(1) request.

🔥 Basic Solidity Questions
1. What is a smart contract?

A self-executing contract with rules written in code stored on Ethereum.

2. What is msg.sender?

Address of the caller of the current function.

3. What is msg.value?

Amount of Ether sent with the call.

4. What is payable?

A function that can receive Ether.

5. What is the difference between call() vs transfer()?

transfer() → limited gas, safer but restrictive

call() → flexible, recommended for sending Ether

🔥 Intermediate Questions
6. What is the fallback function?

Executes when no function matches the call.

7. What is receive()?

Executes on plain Ether transfers with empty calldata.

8. Why use require()?

To validate inputs and protect logic.

9. What is a state variable?

Stored permanently on blockchain.

10. What is an event?

Used to log data for off-chain applications.

🔥 Advanced Questions
11. What is re-entrancy?

An attack where a function calls back repeatedly before completing.

12. How to prevent re-entrancy?

Use Checks → Effects → Interactions pattern.

13. What is ABI?

Defines how external apps communicate with the smart contract.

14. What is storage vs memory?

storage → permanent

memory → temporary RAM

15. What is a gas limit?

Maximum gas allowed for a transaction.
