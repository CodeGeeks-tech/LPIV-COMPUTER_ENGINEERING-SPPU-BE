✅ CODE EXPLANATION – Bank Smart Contract in Solidity

This Solidity program creates a simple bank account system that allows the account owner to:

Deposit money

Withdraw money

View balance

It runs on any Ethereum-based blockchain (test networks like Goerli, Sepolia, or Ganache).

📌 1. SPDX License & Compiler Version
//SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

✔ Explanation:

Every Solidity file starts with a license identifier.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0 ensures the compiler version is 0.8.x.

Version 0.8 includes automatic overflow and underflow protection.

📌 2. Contract Declaration
contract Bank {

✔ Explanation:

Defines a smart contract named Bank. All the functions and variables used for the banking system are inside this contract.

📌 3. State Variables
address private accOwner;
uint256 balance = 0;

✔ Explanation:
✔ accOwner

Stores the Ethereum address of the account owner.

Declared private so only internal functions can access it.

✔ balance

Stores the user’s bank balance in wei (smallest Ether unit).

Initialized to 0.

📌 4. Constructor Function
constructor() {
    accOwner = msg.sender;
}

✔ Explanation:

The constructor runs only once at deployment.

msg.sender is the address that deploys the contract.

This makes the contract deployer the bank account owner.

📌 5. Deposit Function
function Deposit() public payable {
    require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not an account owner!!");
    require(msg.value > 0, "Amount should be greater than 0.");
    balance += msg.value;
}

✔ Explanation:
Conditions enforced by require():

Only the owner can deposit money.

Deposited amount must be greater than 0 wei.

✔ payable keyword:

Required when a function receives Ether.

✔ Logic:

Adds the deposited Ether (msg.value) to the internal balance.

📌 6. Withdraw Function
function Withdraw() public payable {
    require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not an account owner");
    require(msg.value > balance, "Account doesnot have sufficient balance!");
    balance -= msg.value;
}

✔ Explanation:
Conditions:

Only the owner can withdraw.

Withdrawal amount must not exceed total balance.

Logic flaw notice (important for viva):

The condition:

require(msg.value > balance, ...)


Should be:

require(msg.value <= balance, ...)


Because withdrawal should only succeed if balance is enough.

✔ After checks:

Deducts the amount from the balance.

⚠ Important:
This withdraw function only updates the internal balance but does not actually transfer Ether back to the owner.
A real withdraw must include:

payable(msg.sender).transfer(msg.value);


You can mention this in viva for extra marks.

📌 7. Show Balance Function
function showBalance() public view returns(uint256) {
    require(accOwner == msg.sender, "You are not an account owner");
    return balance;
}

✔ Explanation:

view function → does not modify the blockchain.

Only the owner can check the balance.

Returns the account balance stored in the contract.

🎯 FINAL SUMMARY — What This Smart Contract Does

✔ Creates a simple on-chain bank account
✔ Allows only the creator (owner) to:

Deposit Ether

Withdraw Ether

Check balance

✔ Uses important Solidity concepts:

Constructor

Payable functions

Address type

require() for validation

State variables

Ether handling

Access control
