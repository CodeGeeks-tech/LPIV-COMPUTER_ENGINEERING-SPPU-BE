Mini Project- Build a machine learning model that predicts the type of people who survived the Titanic shipwreck using passenger data (i.e. name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.).

THEORY

The Titanic dataset is one of the most widely used datasets for binary classification. The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on their personal details such as age, gender, socio-economic class (Pclass), siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp), parents/children aboard (Parch), ticket fare, and port of embarkation.

This problem is well-suited for classification algorithms. In this project, a Random Forest Classifier is used. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions. It handles missing values, captures non-linear relationships, and reduces overfitting through averaging.

The dataset is preprocessed by filling missing values, encoding categorical variables, training the model, and evaluating its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.


ALGORITHM
Titanic Survival Prediction Algorithm

Start

Load Titanic dataset (tiatanic.xls)

Select relevant features such as Pclass, Age, Sex, Fare, SibSp, Parch, Embarked

Handle missing values:
  • Fill Age with mean
  • Fill Embarked with mode

Convert categorical columns (Sex, Embarked) using Label Encoding

Split data into training set (75%) and testing set (25%)

Initialize the Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees

Train the classifier on the training data

Predict survival for test data

Compute performance metrics:
  • Accuracy
  • Confusion Matrix
  • Precision, Recall, F1-Score (from Classification Report)

Display results

CONCLUSION

In this project, a machine learning model was built to predict Titanic passenger survival. After preprocessing the dataset, a Random Forest Classifier was trained and evaluated. The model delivered strong accuracy and meaningful insights into the factors influencing survival. Ensemble tree-based models like Random Forest are effective for datasets containing both numerical and categorical features, making them suitable for this problem.
