C(1) Write a program in solidity to create Student data. Use the following constructs: 

• Structures
 • Arrays
 • Fallback 
Deploy this as smart contract on Ethereal and Observe the transaction fee and Gas values.


THEORY

Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language used to develop smart contracts on Ethereum. This program stores student data using structures and dynamic arrays, allowing addition and retrieval of student records. A fallback function is used to handle unexpected Ether transfers or wrong function calls. When deployed on Ethereum, every operation consumes gas, which represents computational cost. Gas usage varies depending on operations like storage, loops, and array resizing.

ALGORITHM
Algorithm for Student Smart Contract

Start

Define a Student structure with:
  • name
  • roll number

Create a dynamic array studentArr to store multiple students

Create addStudent() to:
  • Check for duplicate roll numbers
  • If unique, push a new student into array

Create displayAllStudents() to return all stored students

Create getStudentByIndex() to fetch a student by index

Create getLengthOfStudents() to return number of students

Add fallback() function to handle unexpected calls

Deploy contract on Remix / Ethereum testnet

Observe gas fees for deployment and function execution

End

CONCLUSION

The student smart contract demonstrates the use of structures, dynamic arrays, and the fallback function in Solidity. Deploying it on Ethereum shows how gas is consumed for operations, especially storage-related ones. The fallback function ensures robustness against incorrect interactions. This mini-project provides hands-on understanding of smart contract deployment, gas estimation, and blockchain data management.
