A(5) Design n-Queens matrix having first Queen placed. Use backtracking to place remaining Queens to generate the final n-queen‘s matrix.

THEORY
The N-Queens problem consists of placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Queens can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The backtracking method places queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is safe. If a conflict occurs, the algorithm backtracks by removing the previously placed queen and trying the next available column. This is a classic example of using backtracking to explore the solution space efficiently, generating all valid configurations of N queens.

ALGORITHM

Backtracking Algorithm for N-Queens

Start

Create an N×N matrix initialized with 0’s

Place a queen in the first row (or allow input to place first queen)

For each row:
  • For each column in that row:
    – Check if placing a queen here is safe
    – If safe: place queen and move to next row
    – If not safe: try next column

If all queens are placed → print the board

If no column is safe → backtrack to previous row and move queen

Continue until all solutions are printed

End

Safety Check Conditions:

No other queen in same column

No queen in left diagonal

No queen in right diagonal

Time Complexity: O(N!) (worst case)
Space Complexity: O(N²) for board storage, O(N) recursion stack

CONCLUSION
The N-Queens problem showcases how backtracking systematically explores possible arrangements while avoiding invalid configurations. By placing one queen per row and checking for safety before proceeding, the algorithm efficiently eliminates large portions of the search space. Backtracking ensures that all valid solutions (or at least one) are found, making this approach optimal for constraint satisfaction problems.
