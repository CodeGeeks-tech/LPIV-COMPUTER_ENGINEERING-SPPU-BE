A(3) Write a program to solve a fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy method

THEORY
The Fractional Knapsack problem is an optimization problem where each item has a value and weight, and the goal is to maximize total value in a knapsack with limited capacity. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack, here we are allowed to take fractions of items. The greedy strategy sorts items based on their value-to-weight ratio and selects the item that provides the highest gain per unit weight. This approach guarantees an optimal solution because at every step it picks the most value-efficient option.

ALGORITHM

Fractional Knapsack Algorithm (Greedy Strategy)

Start

Input number of items, along with their weights and values

Input knapsack capacity

Compute value/weight ratio for all items

Sort items in descending order of ratio

For each item in sorted order:
  • If full item fits, add entire value and reduce capacity
  • Else, take fractional part equal to remaining capacity
  • Break if capacity becomes zero

Display the maximum value obtained

End

Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
Space Complexity: O(n)

CONCLUSION
The Fractional Knapsack problem demonstrates the power of the greedy strategy: by always choosing the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio, we obtain the most efficient and optimal solution. Since fractions of items are allowed, the greedy choice never leads to a suboptimal outcome. This makes the fractional knapsack problem one of the classic examples where the greedy method guarantees optimality with excellent time efficiency.
