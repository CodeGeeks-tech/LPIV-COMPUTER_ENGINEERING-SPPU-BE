✅ CODE EXPLANATION – Fibonacci (Recursive & Non-Recursive)

This program computes and displays the Fibonacci series using two different methods:

Recursive method

Non-recursive (iterative) method

The program also allows the user to specify how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence they want.

🔹 1. recursive_fibonacci(n) – Recursive Approach
def recursive_fibonacci(n): 
    if n <= 1: 
        return n 
    else: 
        return recursive_fibonacci(n-1) + recursive_fibonacci(n-2)

✔ Explanation:

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

This function directly implements that mathematical definition using recursion.

Base Case:
If n is 0 or 1 → return n

Recursive Case:
Otherwise, call the function again for previous two values and return their sum.

✔ Characteristics:

Easy to understand but slow, because many values are recomputed repeatedly.

Time Complexity: O(2ⁿ)

Space Complexity: O(n) (due to recursion stack)

🔹 2. non_recursive_fibonacci(n) – Iterative Approach
def non_recursive_fibonacci(n): 
    first = 0 
    second = 1 
    print(first)
    if n > 1:
        print(second)
    for i in range(2, n):
        third = first + second 
        print(third)
        first, second = second, third 

✔ Explanation:

Starts by manually printing the first two Fibonacci numbers: 0 and 1.

If the user wants more than one term, it prints both.

Then it enters a loop from 2 up to n:

Computes the next Fibonacci number as:
third = first + second

Prints this number

Updates variables for the next iteration:
first ← second
second ← third

✔ Characteristics:

Much faster than recursion.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) (only three variables used)

🔹 3. Main Program
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    n = int(input("Enter how many terms you want: "))


Reads the number of Fibonacci terms from the user.

    print("\nFibonacci Series using Recursive Method:")
    for i in range(n): 
        print(recursive_fibonacci(i))


Uses recursion to compute each term from 0 to n−1

Prints each value individually

    print("\nFibonacci Series using Non-Recursive (Iterative) Method:")
    non_recursive_fibonacci(n)


Calls the iterative function to print the same sequence.

✅ Final Summary
Method	Approach	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Speed
Recursive	function calls itself (F(n−1)+F(n−2))	O(2ⁿ)	O(n)	Slow
Non-Recursive	loop-based, uses variables	O(n)	O(1)	Fast

The recursive method is simple but inefficient.

The iterative method is efficient and practical for large n.
