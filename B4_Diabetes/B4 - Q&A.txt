1. What is the purpose of the diabetes.csv dataset?

Answer:
It contains medical diagnostic measurements to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes (Outcome = 1 or 0).

2. What does the Outcome column represent?

Answer:
It is the target variable:

1 → Patient has diabetes

0 → Patient does not have diabetes

3. Why are some zero values replaced with NaN in preprocessing?

Answer:
Because zero is an invalid value for features like BloodPressure, BMI, etc.
These are replaced with mean values.

4. Why use mean replacement for missing values?

Answer:
Mean imputation is simple and preserves the overall distribution without removing rows.

5. What is KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)?

Answer:
A distance-based classification algorithm that assigns a class based on the majority vote of the k nearest neighbors.

6. What value of k is used in the program?

Answer:
k = 5 neighbors.

7. Why is scaling important in KNN?

Answer:
Because KNN depends on distance, and features with larger scales dominate smaller ones.
(Note: your code does not scale, but ideally should.)

8. What distance metric does KNN use by default?

Answer:
Euclidean distance.

9. What is the role of train_test_split()?

Answer:
To divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for proper evaluation.

10. What does knn.fit(X_train, Y_train) do?

Answer:
Stores all training samples (lazy learning).
No actual model is built — classification happens during prediction.

11. What does the confusion matrix represent?

Answer:
A 2×2 matrix showing:

True Positives (TP)

True Negatives (TN)

False Positives (FP)

False Negatives (FN)

12. What is accuracy?

Answer:
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (Total samples)

13. What is error rate?

Answer:
Error rate = 1 – accuracy

14. What does precision measure?

Answer:
Out of all predicted diabetic cases, how many were actually diabetic.
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

15. What does recall measure?

Answer:
Out of actual diabetic patients, how many were correctly detected.
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

16. What does the F1-score represent?

Answer:
Harmonic mean of precision and recall; good for imbalanced datasets.

17. Why is diabetes prediction considered a good use case for KNN?

Answer:
Because it is a binary classification problem with continuous medical features.

18. What does iloc[:, :8] select?

Answer:
The first 8 columns, all of which are feature variables.

19. Why does the code convert zeros to NaN before filling with mean?

Answer:
To correctly apply mean imputation only to intended missing-like values.

20. Why do we use random_state=0?

Answer:
To make results reproducible by ensuring the same random split each run.

21. Why is KNN considered a lazy learner?

Answer:
It simply stores the training data and does not build a mathematical model.

22. What happens if k is too small?

Answer:
The model becomes sensitive to noise (overfitting).

23. What happens if k is too large?

Answer:
The model becomes too generalized and may misclassify (underfitting).

24. What kind of dataset is diabetes.csv? Balanced or imbalanced?

Answer:
Imbalanced — typically around:

65% non-diabetic

35% diabetic
Hence metrics like recall and F1 are important.

25. What is the final output of the program?

Answer:
It prints:

Confusion matrix

Accuracy

Error rate

Precision

Recall

F1-score

This helps evaluate the model’s overall performance.
