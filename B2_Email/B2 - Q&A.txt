1. What type of classification problem is email spam detection?

Answer:
It is a binary classification problem with two classes:

0 → Not Spam

1 → Spam

2. What features are used in the given dataset?

Answer:
The dataset contains word frequency values (columns 1–3000), representing how often each word appears in an email.

3. Why do we use train_test_split()?

Answer:
To divide data into training (learn patterns) and testing (evaluate performance) subsets.

4. What percentage of data is used for testing?

Answer:
25% (test_size = 0.25).

5. What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

Answer:
A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors.

6. What value of k is used in this program?

Answer:
k = 7 neighbors.

7. Why does KNN require feature scaling usually?

Answer:
Because distance-based algorithms are sensitive to different feature ranges.
(Though your code does not apply scaling.)

8. What type of classifier is SVM?

Answer:
A margin-based classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane separating two classes.

9. What kernel is used for SVM here?

Answer:
kernel='rbf' (Radial Basis Function), which handles non-linear boundaries.

10. What does gamma='auto' do?

Answer:
It sets gamma to 1/n_features, controlling how far the influence of a training example reaches.

11. What performance metric is printed first for both models?

Answer:
Accuracy Score, which measures the percentage of correctly classified emails.

12. What is a confusion matrix?

Answer:
A table showing:

True Positives (TP)

True Negatives (TN)

False Positives (FP)

False Negatives (FN)

Used to assess classifier quality.

13. Why is accuracy not always a reliable metric for spam detection?

Answer:
Because datasets may be imbalanced. Other metrics like recall and F1-score are more informative.

14. What does “classification_report” print?

Answer:
Precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

15. What does precision measure?

Answer:
Out of all emails predicted as spam, how many were actually spam.
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

16. What does recall measure?

Answer:
Out of all actual spam emails, how many the model correctly detected.
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

17. Which classifier generally performs better on high-dimensional text data?

Answer:
SVM, because it handles sparse high-dimensional data effectively.

18. Why might KNN perform poorly on this dataset?

Answer:
Because the dataset has thousands of features, making distance calculations expensive and less meaningful (curse of dimensionality).

19. What is the purpose of using iloc[:, 1:3001]?

Answer:
To extract word-frequency features, excluding the first non-numeric column.

20. Why do we skip the first column of the dataset?

Answer:
It likely contains an ID or non-feature column (common in email datasets).

21. What does SVC(C=1.0) mean?

Answer:
C controls regularization strength.
Lower C → allows more misclassifications (more generalization)
Higher C → stricter classification (risk of overfitting)

22. What is overfitting?

Answer:
When a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data because it memorized patterns instead of learning general ones.

23. Which model in your program is more likely to overfit?

Answer:
SVM with a high C or KNN with very small k may overfit.

24. Why is KNN considered a lazy learner?

Answer:
It does not learn a model; it stores data and performs classification during prediction only.

25. Why is SVM often preferred in spam filtering applications?

Answer:
Because it works very well with:

High-dimensional data

Sparse vectors

Non-linear boundaries (with RBF kernel)
And provides high accuracy.
