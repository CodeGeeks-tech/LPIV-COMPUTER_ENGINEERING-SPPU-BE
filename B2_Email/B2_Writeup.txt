B(2) Classify the email using the binary classification method. Email Spam detection has two states: a) Normal State – Not Spam, b) Abnormal State – Spam. Use K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine for classification. Analyze their performance. 

THEORY

Email spam detection is a binary classification problem where emails are labeled as either Normal (Not Spam) or Abnormal (Spam). Machine learning algorithms can be trained on past email datasets to learn patterns such as word frequencies or meta-features. Two commonly used classification models are:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Instance-based, lazy learning algorithm

Classifies a new email based on the majority class of its K nearest neighbors

Sensitive to noise and high-dimensional data

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Finds an optimal hyperplane that maximizes margin between the two classes

Works well with high-dimensional sparse data (like email word vectors)

RBF kernel used for non-linear classification

The dataset "emails.csv" contains thousands of word-frequency features along with a binary spam label. The goal is to train both KNN and SVM and compare their accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.



ALGORITHM
1. Data Preprocessing

Load email dataset

Extract word-frequency features as X

Extract label (0 = not spam, 1 = spam) as Y

Split data into training and testing sets

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

Choose value of K (here K = 7)

For each test email:
  • Compute distance from training points
  • Select K nearest neighbors
  • Predict class based on majority vote

Evaluate accuracy and confusion matrix

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification

Use SVM with RBF kernel

Fit model with training features

Predict labels for test data

Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

4. Performance Comparison

Compare SVM vs. KNN accuracy

Compare confusion matrices

Identify which classifier detects spam more accurately

CONCLUSION

Email spam classification using machine learning is an effective approach for detecting unwanted emails. The experiment demonstrates that Support Vector Machine significantly outperforms KNN for high-dimensional datasets such as word-frequency email features. SVM offers higher accuracy, better robustness to noise, and a more reliable decision boundary. KNN, while simpler, struggles with dimensionality and tends to produce lower accuracy. This experiment clearly shows why SVM is widely preferred in text classification tasks.
